In this project, I performed an extensive analysis of global terror activities using a comprehensive dataset.
The goal was to uncover patterns, trends, and insights into terrorist incidents across different regions and time periods.
The dataset contained information about the type of attacks, targets, locations, and the severity of incidents.
